This project is a front-end clone of the Gmail user interface, developed using HTML and CSS. It replicates the visual layout of Gmail, including components like the header, sidebar, and email list section. The design is static and focuses on presenting a clean and organized structure similar to the actual Gmail interface. The HTML file structures the layout, while the CSS file handles styling, colors, and formatting. Assets such as icons are included to enhance the appearance. The project is intended for practicing front-end design skills and could be expanded in the future with JavaScript for interactivity and responsiveness.
